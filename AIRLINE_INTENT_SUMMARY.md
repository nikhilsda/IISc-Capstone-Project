## Technical Implementation

### UI/UX Architecture
The application now features a **responsive dual-panel layout**:

#### **Left Panel - Chat Interface** (2/3 width)
- **Main conversation area** with message history
- **Intent badges** with color-coded classification
- **Confidence bars** showing classification accuracy
- **Quick test buttons** for airline scenarios
- **Message input** with real-time typing indicators

#### **Right Panel - Session Management** (1/3 width)
- **Session information** with full UUID and timestamps
- **Live statistics** (message counts, confidence averages)
- **Intent distribution** with visual badges
- **Conversation history** (last 10 messages)
- **Session health indicators** and management actions

### Intent Classification Logic
The system uses a **hierarchical priority-based approach**:

1. **High Priority**: Specific actions (Cancellation, Refund, Check-in, Upgrade)
2. **Medium Priority**: Specific features (Seating, Meals, Boarding, Amenities)
3. **Lower Priority**: General categories (Information, Inquiry, Support)

### Phrase vs. Word Matching
- **Phrase matching**: More specific contexts (e.g., "cancel booking")
- **Word matching**: Individual keywords with context validation
- **Compound logic**: Multiple conditions for better accuracy

### Confidence Scoring
- **0.9**: High confidence (specific actions like Cancellation, Refund)
- **0.85**: Medium-high confidence (common actions like Booking, Support)
- **0.8**: Medium confidence (feature-specific intents)
- **0.75**: Medium-low confidence (general information)
- **0.6**: Low confidence (fallback cases)

### Session Management Features
- **UUID-based session tracking** for conversation isolation
- **Real-time session statistics** with auto-refresh capabilities
